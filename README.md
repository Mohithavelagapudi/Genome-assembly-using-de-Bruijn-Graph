# Genome-assembly-using-de-Bruijn-Graph
Genome assembly is a critical step in bioinformatics, where the goal is to reconstruct the complete DNA sequence of an organism from short DNA fragments called reads. De Bruijn Graph is a fundamental data structure and algorithm used in genome assembly, particularly for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data
